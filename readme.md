# Fine-Tuned ChatGPT with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Using Milvus

## Objective
This project aims to:
1. Answer user queries using ChatGPT based only on a 5GB text dataset.
2. Provide fallback responses like "I don't know" if no relevant data is available.
3. Collect user queries, retrieved data, and GPT responses over time to fine-tune the model for domain-specific accuracy.

---

## Architecture
The system is composed of the following components:

### 1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
- **Steps:**
  - Load and clean the dataset.
  - Split data into manageable chunks (500–1000 tokens).
  - Generate vector embeddings for chunks using OpenAI Embeddings API or Sentence Transformers.
  - Store embeddings and metadata in Milvus.
- **Tools:**
  - OpenAI Embeddings API / Sentence Transformers.
  - Milvus for vector storage.

### 2. Information Retrieval (IR)
- **Steps:**
  - Accept user queries via frontend or API.
  - Convert the query into an embedding.
  - Perform a similarity search in Milvus to retrieve the top-k relevant chunks.
  - Combine the retrieved chunks into a coherent context for ChatGPT.
- **Tools:**
  - Milvus for similarity search.
  - Python SDK (`pymilvus`) for database querying.

### 3. RAG Integration
- **Steps:**
  - Send user query and retrieved context to ChatGPT via API.
  - Use a prompt template including:
    - User Query.
    - Retrieved Context.
    - Instruction: “Answer only based on the provided context. If insufficient, say, ‘I don’t know.’”
  - Return ChatGPT’s response to the user.
- **Tools:**
  - OpenAI GPT API.
  - Backend logic to format prompts and handle user queries.

### 4. Feedback Loop
- **Steps:**
  - Log the user query, retrieved context, and GPT’s response.
  - Collect feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down or custom comments).
  - Use this data to improve retrieval accuracy and build a dataset for fine-tuning.
- **Tools:**
  - Logging system (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB, Elasticsearch).

### 5. Fine-Tuning GPT (Future Stage)
- **Steps:**
  - Use logged data (query, context, response, feedback) to prepare a fine-tuning dataset.
  - Fine-tune ChatGPT using OpenAI’s fine-tuning API or parameter-efficient methods like LoRA.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Preprocess the dataset and create embeddings for Milvus.
2. **Query Processing:**
   - User submits a query via the frontend.
   - Convert the query into an embedding and search Milvus for relevant chunks.
3. **Response Generation:**
   - Pass the query and retrieved context to ChatGPT.
   - Return the response to the user.
4. **Feedback Collection:**
   - Log query-context-response pairs and collect user feedback.

---

## Scalability Plan
1. **Data Growth:**
   - Use Milvus’s distributed mode for datasets larger than 5GB.
2. **Compute Efficiency:**
   - Batch embedding generation or use GPU acceleration.
3. **Cloud Deployment:**
   - Deploy Milvus and RAG system on Kubernetes or a managed cloud service.

---

## Benefits
- **Scalable Retrieval:** Handles large datasets efficiently with Milvus.
- **Low Overhead:** Leverages existing tools for fast deployment.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Fine-tuning capabilities and feedback loops ensure the system evolves over time.

## Next Steps
1. Preprocess the dataset and store embeddings in Milvus.
2. Build a retrieval system integrated with ChatGPT.
3. Implement a feedback loop for continuous improvement.
4. Fine-tune GPT with the collected data for domain-specific optimization.
